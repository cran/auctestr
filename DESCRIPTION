Description: Performs statistical testing to compare predictive 
	models based on multiple observations of the A' statistic (also known as 
	Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, or AUC). 
	Specifically, it implements a testing method based on the equivalence 
	between the A' statistic and the Wilcoxon statistic. 
	For more information, see Hanley and McNeil (1982) <doi:10.1148/radiology.143.1.7063747>.
